# TabbedBar

This is an Appcelerator Titanium Alloy widget that mimics the TabbedBar object from the namespace Ti.UI.iPhone for the Android platform.
It has Event Handlers and Animations for a Page Change that matches the Material Design.

## ToDo

Write a decent README teaching how to use the object. Set It's index programmatically, listen to events on It, et cetera.
